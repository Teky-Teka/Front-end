 Project objectives

    Set up your first routes
    Implement different HTTP verbs
    Manipulate query paramaters & request arguments

Take a couple of days to discover the Flask framework through a series of exercices. What you will see during those exercices will be the basis of your work for the next 4 weeks!

 Overview

The time has come to build your first actual web application!

But we will start small: instead of having a full-fledged application with a user interface, we will start with an API.

We will do so with a tool that's perfect to get started: the Flask framework. It is a lightweight framework that uses Python to create small (or medium) web applications.

Instead of diving right into the actual application, we will spend two days discovering how web applications work and how they answer simple requests.

The rest of the project will be a natural continuation of those exercices, so be sure to do them seriously!
Getting started

Install Flask by running this command in your console:

$> pip3 install Flask

And watch the video before diving into the exercices! 

Don't forget to look for more resources on the internet if necessary. The documentation we provide is never meant to be exhaustive.
