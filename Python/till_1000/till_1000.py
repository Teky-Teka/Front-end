# Write a Python program that prompts the user for a starting number, and
# consecutive operations on that number. The program quits only when the number
# reaches or exceeds 1000.

# If a division by 0 is attempted, an error message is displayed, and the
# program continues normally.

# Note that for the division operation, you have to use the floor division
# operator //.


# number_1 is a string from the input()
number_1 = input("Enter the starting number: ")
# number_1 is casted in integer with int()
number_1 = int(number_1)

# While number_1 < 1000 operates to reach 1000 or more
While number_1 < 1000:
	number_2
	if 1000 - number_1 > 0
