# Write a function named raise_employees that takes a dictionary describing \
# the employees of a company as argument (with each key having as value a \
# nested dictionary with the employee's title and salary).
#Â Your function will return the dictionary after having raised the salary \
# of some employees.
# Only the employees that are not C-levels (a C-level employee is someone \
# whose job title starts with a "C" and ends with an "O") will get \
# a $100 raise.
